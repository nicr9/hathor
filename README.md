# Hathor

Hathor is a Podcast Proxy Server written in go.

## About

Hathor is a server that will cache copies of podcasts you subscribe to and serve them back to your podcatcher.

Hathor will soon support an array of options to modify podcasts such as re-encoding them for you.

## Attributions

The podcast catching logic was adapted from a [go-pkg-rss example](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-pkg-rss/blob/master/testdata/example.go).

The idea for hathor came about from a conversation with [a friend](https://twitter.com/jaimebuelta) at work about audio encodings.
